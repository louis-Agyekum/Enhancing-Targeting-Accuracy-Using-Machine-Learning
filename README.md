# Enhancing-Targeting-Accuracy-Using-Machine-Learning
Our client, a grocery retailer, sent out mailers in a marketing campaign for their new *delivery club*.  This cost customers $100 per year for membership, and offered free grocery deliveries, rather than the normal cost of $10 per delivery.

For this, they sent mailers to their entire customer base (apart from a control group) but this proved expensive.  For the next batch of communications they would like to save costs by *only* mailing customers that were likely to sign up.

Based upon the results of the last campaign and the customer data available, we will look to understand the *probability* of customers signing up for the *delivery club*.  This would allow the client to mail a more targeted selection of customers, lowering costs, and improving ROI.
